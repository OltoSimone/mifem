# mifem

v3.0.1

*mimetic finite element method*

To my knowledge, mifem so far is the most powerful implementation of the 
*mimetic spectral element method*.


Here we host the *mifem* library. Currently, no detailed documentation
is implemented as the number of users is quite low. 


Do
> mpiexec python TESTS\mpi_unittest.py

to run all the tests.
